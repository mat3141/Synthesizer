# Synthesizer

An additive synthesizer in MATLAB

The synthesizer starts with one of four fundamental waveforms - sin, square, triangle, and sawtooth - and allows the user to build up a waveform by controlling the amplitude of the harmonics of the wave. To run the project, make sure to have the Signal Processing and DSP System Toolboxes installed. For starters, try a sine wave with the 1st harmonic maximized by moving that corresponding slider all the way to the right, the 3rd harmonic at about 35%, and the 4th harmonic at 50%. Increase Tremelo to about 35% and press and hold Q, E, and T simultaneously on the keyboard. It should sound like an electric piano playing a C major chord.
